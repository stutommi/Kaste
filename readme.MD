Hi!

This is my code for a plant watering project. Some notes below for info about.

It's build using technologies from MERN-stack.

- This project is changing very often as the project goal hasn't been met yet.
- Majority of the code is quite messy. I've cleaned up the main app.js file on client side, but mostly code is uncommented.
- Needs DRY up and improve consistency with naming.
- One issue I need to tackle dearly is CSS. As this is my first react project, I've found out that styling components isn't so straightforward. I'm thinking of trying out FELA, but before I get my hands dirty with that. normal css files will have to do.

- Feel free to look around the code. I've changed server.js with duplicate that hides sensitive information! If you have any tips for improvement, I'm more than happy to hear them. :)

- Tommi
